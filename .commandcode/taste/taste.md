# excalidraw-diagrams
- Use Excalidraw's handwritten font (fontFamily: 1, Excalifont/Virgil) for text in diagrams. Confidence: 0.75
- Use explicit bound text elements (text with containerId + shape with boundElements) instead of the label shorthand, which is not implemented. Confidence: 0.85
- Use sloppy/rough style (roughness: 2) and rounded edges (roundness: {type: 3}) on shapes by default in Excalidraw diagrams for a hand-drawn look. Confidence: 0.75

# x-posts
- Format X posts about CLI tools as detailed product announcements: start with intro line, include terminal demo block, structured feature sections with bullet points, usage examples, and end with engagement question. Not short/casual — make them comprehensive. Confidence: 0.65
